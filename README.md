# pokemon-api
The purpose of this project was to utilize fundamental knowledge of APIs and UI patterns to build a website. For my website, I chose the pokemon API to retrieve data about my favorite pokemon, charizard. Using a simple design and a color scheme focused on grabbing attention, users can learn about charizard's top stats. It's easy to understand why he is a crowd favorite in the pokemon universe. 

## Features 
By taking advantage of color, motion, and interactive design, I was able to recreate a modal UI pattern. Hovering over each button elicits a change in color signifying the ability to click and access information from the pokemon server. By clicking on each button on the page the user is not only introduced to a new fact about charizard, but the color of the webpage changes to indicate that the button has been clicked as well.
